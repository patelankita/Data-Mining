# readmission-rate-analysis
Used data-mining techniques to predict readmission rates of Diabetes patients within one month of discharge from hospital.

# Problem Statement


Design and implement a model, run experiments on a real world data-set.
The program should be a two-class classifier that can handle data-sets with
 an arbitrary number of features and instances.
 The language of implementation is up to you â€” the only requirement is that your program
 be able to interpret the data format specified below, and be able to classify instances
 and produce interesting statistics such as accuracy, variance, etc.

The task is to predict, as accurately as possible, whether a person will be readmitted within 30 days after being discharged from the hospital. A more detailed description of the dataset can be found under
